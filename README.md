ETCH-A-SKETCH

This is more of a learning project, learning to use Javascript and event listeners.

it demontrates that i am able to use javascript to manipulate the DOM.

it asks for a grid size which can be between 4-64 and creates a grid of that size within a box, when the mouse moves over any of the grid cells the background colour will change to a randomly generated colour.
